All code necessary to run all iterations of ADMIXTURE from MAC=2-10, and k=1-5 can be found in this subdirectory. The calculation of optimal k value and ancestry assignment for all samples for each run is available for viewing at: https://devonderaad.github.io/towhees.uces/ADMIXTURE/prep.vis.admixture.plots.html

Each directory contains a vcf file filtered according to the MAC cutoff specified in the title, as well as a file named 'binary_fileset.bed' that is the corresponding input file for that ADMIXTURE iteration.
