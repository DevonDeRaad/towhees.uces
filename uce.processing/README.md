We started by cleaning our reads using illumiprocessor following the script 'run.illumiprocessor.sh'. We then assembled these cleaned reads for each sample using Spades, following the script 'run.assembly.spades.sh'. We then followed the UCE SNP calling pipeline found in the script 'uce.snp.calling.pipeline.txt'. Finally, we performed additional SNP filtering using the SNPfiltR package, which can be viewed here: https://devonderaad.github.io/towhees.uces/uce.processing/towhee.filt.html
