'prepare.snapp.input.files.R' details exactly how I used the unlinked SNP vcf file to generate inputs for SNAPP and run each iteration on the KU cluster. Files ending with the extension '.xml' are SNAPP input files generated in Beauti. Files with '.trees' extension contain output trees sampled from the posterior distribution of each run, '.log' files contain MCMC trace info, and 'snapp.rep2.converged.tree.pdf' shows the output trees for the only run that achieved stationarity (rep2).
